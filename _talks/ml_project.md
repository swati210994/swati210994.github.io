* Project description:
  * Processed past 10 years financial data from Yahoo Finance to extract technical indicator features such as RSI,
MASI, and EMA. This project focuses on predicting stock price trend for a company in near future.

  * The prepared dataset looks like the figure shown below .

  * Proposed Methods:
    * Linear Regression
    * Regression using SVM
    * ANN Regression
    
  * Created Indictor functions:
  
    * Technical indicators use statistical properties of the present and previous samples, so it can be considered as more           related feature as it becomes easy to uptrend and downtrend.
    
    * Technical indicators used:
      
      * Relative Strength Index (RSI)
        * Measures speed and change of price movements.
        * RSI = 100 – [100 / ( 1 + (Average of Upward Price Change / Average of Downward Price Change))]
        * Generally, oscillates between 0 and 100, we consider overbrought above 70 and oversold below 30.
        
        
      * Money Flow Index (MFI)
         * Related to RSI but incorporates volume too where RSI considers prices only.
         * Typical Price = (High + Low + Close)/3
         * Money Flow (not the Money Flow Index) is calculated by multiplying the period's Typical Price by the volume.
         * Money Flow = Typical Price * Volume
         * If today's Typical Price is greater than yesterday's typical Price,it is considered Positive Money Flow.
         * If today's price is less, it is considered Negative Money Flow.
         * Money Ratio = Positive Money Flow / Negative Money Flow.
         
      * Exponential Moving average (EMI)
        * SMA = avg of price data, EMA = more weight to data which is more current.
        * EMA is more sensitive to price movement and used to determine trend direction
        * EMA = (K x (C - P)) + P <br/>
          where, C = Current Price <br/>
          P = Previous periods EMA (A SMA is used for the first periods calculations) <br/>
          K = Exponential smoothing constant.
      
      * Stochastic Oscillator (SO)
        * Shows the location of the close relative to high-low range over a set number of periods.
        * The default setting is 14 periods, which can be days,weeks,months or an intraday timeframe.
        * K=100[(C-L5close)➗(H5-L5)] <br/>
          C=the most recent closing price <br/>
          L5=the low of the five previous trading sessions <br/>
          H5=the highest price traded during the same five-day pe
          
      * [Jupyter Notebook for Technical indicators calculations](/notebooks/Technical_indicator_cal.ipynb)
      
  * Evaluated extensive comparisons among the metrics MSE, MAE, and percentage error.
  * Implemented different models such as linear regression, support vector regression and ANN.
     * Support Vector Machine

       *  [Jupyter Notebook](/notebooks/ANN.ipynb)
     
  * Achieved error rate as low as 0.64% using support vector regression in NIFTY index prediction.
